"""
Treatment variation diagnostics for DML-based insurance elasticity estimation.

The near-deterministic price problem is the central challenge in applying DML
to insurance renewal data. Insurance re-rating makes the price change nearly
a deterministic function of observable risk factors. When that happens, the DML
residual D̃ = D - E[D|X] has near-zero variance, making the causal estimator
numerically unreliable — exactly analogous to weak instruments in IV.

This module diagnoses the problem before fitting and reports actionable
suggestions. It is the library's key differentiator from naive ML approaches
that skip this check entirely.

    Attributes

    treatment_var:
        Total variance of the treatment variable D (log price change).
    residual_var:
        Variance of D̃ = D - E[D|X] (the part of price change not explained
        by confounders). This is what DML uses for identification.
    variation_fraction:
        Var(D̃) / Var(D). The fraction of price variation that is exogenous
        with respect to the observable risk factors. Values below 0.10 indicate
        the near-deterministic price problem.
    nuisance_r2:
        R² of the treatment nuisance model E[D|X]. High R² means most price
        variation is predictable from risk factors — leaving little for DML.
    n_obs:
        Number of observations used.
    weak_treatment:
        Whether the variation fraction is below the minimum threshold (0.10).
        If True, DML results should not be trusted without further investigation.
    suggestions:
        Actionable suggestions for improving identification when
        weak_treatment is True.
