FCA PS21/5-compliant renewal pricing optimiser.

PS21/5 (General Insurance Pricing Practices) came into force in January 2022.
Its core requirement: a renewing customer must not be quoted a price that
exceeds the equivalent new business price (ENBP). The rule applies per policy,
not on average.

This module takes the causal elasticity estimates and solves the pricing
optimisation problem:

    max  sum_i  (p_i - c_i) * P(renew_i | p_i)
    s.t. p_i <= ENBP_i                  (FCA ICOBS 6B.2 constraint)
         p_i >= c_i * floor_loading     (technical floor)

where P(renew_i | p_i) is derived from the linear demand approximation:

    P(renew | p) = P(renew | p_0) + theta_i * (log(p) - log(p_0))

for small price changes, with theta_i = CATE from the elasticity model.

This is a separable problem (each policy optimised independently) which
scipy.optimize.minimize with SLSQP solves efficiently. The separability is the
key practical advantage of the linear demand approximation.

Design decision — linear vs. logistic demand:
    The logistic model P(renew | log_p) = sigmoid(intercept + theta * log_p)
    is theoretically cleaner. But it requires calibrating the intercept per
    customer, which means retaining the full nuisance model at scoring time.
    The linear approximation P(renew | delta_p) = P0 + theta * delta_log_p
    only needs theta and the observed P0 (renewal rate in the training window).
    For price changes in [-20%, +20%], the linear approximation is accurate
    to within 1-2 percentage points. Good enough for optimisation.

ENBP compliance audit:
    The enbp_audit() method returns a per-row flag for whether the proposed
    price breaches the FCA constraint. It is designed to feed directly into
    a pricing QA process.

class RenewalPricingOptimiser:
    """FCA PS21/5-compliant renewal pricing optimiser.

    Uses the estimated heterogeneous elasticity (CATE) to find the
    profit-maximising or retention-targeting renewal price for each policy,
    subject to the ENBP constraint.

    Parameters
    ----------
    elasticity_model:
        A fitted :class:`~insurance_elasticity.fit.RenewalElasticityEstimator`.
    technical_premium_col:
        Column name of the technical (cost-equivalent) premium. This is the
        floor reference — the optimiser will not price below
        ``technical_premium_col * floor_loading``.
    enbp_col:
        Column name of the equivalent new business price. This is the FCA
        ceiling. The optimiser will not price above this.
    floor_loading:
        Minimum price as a multiple of technical premium. Default 1.0 (no
        discounting below tech). Set to 0.95 to allow up to 5% discount.

    Examples
